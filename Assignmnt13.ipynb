    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: When creating a custom exception in Python, it is recommended to inherit from the Exception class or any of its subclasses.\n",
    "Here are the reasons why it is beneficial to use the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Consistency and Compatibility: Inheriting from the Exception class ensures that your custom exception follows the same structure \n",
    "and behavior as other built-in exceptions in Python. This consistency makes it easier for developers to understand and work with your custom exception \n",
    "as they can rely on familiar exception handling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Exception Hierarchy: The Exception class is the base class for all exceptions in Python, forming a hierarchy of exception classes. By inheriting \n",
    "from the Exception class, your custom exception becomes part of this hierarchy. This allows you to categorize and organize exceptions based on their \n",
    "relationships, making it easier to handle and catch specific types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Error Handling: In Python, exception handling is typically done using the try-except construct. By inheriting from the Exception class, \n",
    "your custom exception can be caught using a broad except block that handles exceptions of type Exception. This provides a convenient way \n",
    "to handle multiple custom exceptions in a single except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Standard Exception Methods: The Exception class provides standard methods like __str__ and __repr__ for representing the exception as a string \n",
    "and for providing a formal representation, respectively. By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception inherits these methods, \n",
    "allowing you to customize the string representation and behavior of your exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Compatibility with Exception Handling Constructs: Python provides various exception handling constructs like try-except,\n",
    "try-except-else, and try-finally. By using the Exception class as the base class for your custom exception, you ensure compatibility with\n",
    "these constructs, making it easier to handle your custom exception in different scenarios."
